        <h2>Buttery, soft pancakes!</h2>
        <p>These flapjack pancakes are quick, easy, and turn out fluffy every time. The recipe can be easily adjusted to your dietary needs, too. I have tried many recipes; this one is simple, yummy, and fail-proof! A word of caution: they're very filling.</p>
